# Backstage-Content-Management-System
The project uses a mainstream SSM framework for rapid development. The database uses MySQL and the data cache uses Redis to support basic additions, deletions, changes, and searches. The front-end framework uses layui, which is small but powerful and suitable for developing background interfaces
